# Quantum Imaging Using Complex Degree of Coherence

As part of a team of four, I worked on creating an executable paper demonstrating a quantum imaging technique using the concepts of Complex Degree of Coherence.
In this project, I analysed methods in optical imaging and metrology of remote bodies through measurements of quantum parameters using linear optics and quantum photon number resolving detectors.
I helped demonstrate the limitations of classical imaging due to the Rayleigh diffraction limit and suggested improvements by simulating a quantum imaging framework in the executable paper. To do this, I implemented an image reconstruction algorithm based on Fourier Transformations
