# Helioseismology and Exotic Particle Physics 
### [May’21-Present]
### Prof. Vikram Rentala, IIT Bombay
#### As part of this project, studied the equations of stellar structure, stellar oscillations, basics of Helioseismology, including observational and inversion techniques and the solar abundance problem
#### I further explored various existing solutions proposed to the solar abundance problem as part of Prof. Rentala’s research group
#### I covered a possible non-diffusive energy transport solution in greater depth, involving exotic particle physics
