# Helioseismology and Exotic Particle Physics 
### Prof. Vikram Rentala, IIT Bombay
<div style="text-align: right"> [May '21 - Present]
#### As part of this project, studied the equations of stellar structure, stellar oscillations, basics of Helioseismology, including observational and inversion techniques and the solar abundance problem
#### I further explored various existing solutions proposed to the solar abundance problem as part of Prof. Rentalaâ€™s research group
#### I covered a possible non-diffusive energy transport solution in greater depth, involving exotic particle physics
