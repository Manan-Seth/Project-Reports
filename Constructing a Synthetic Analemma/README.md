# Constructing a Synthetic Analemma
### Krittika Summer Projects, Krittika - The Astronomy Club, Institute Technical Project, III Bombay [May '20 - Aug '20]
In this project I worked as a team of eight to study the complex orbital motions from the earth's frame of reference giving rise to Analemmas\
This project introduced me to various coordinate systems, including the equitorial system, and how to work with it in Python\
Through the equations of motion and python based simulations, we determined the effect of various parameters on the shape of the Analemma\
A few members of the group also created an animation in blender showing the shape of the analemma for given input parameters
