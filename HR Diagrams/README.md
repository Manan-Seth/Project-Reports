# Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams
### Krittika Winter Projects, Krittika - The Astronomy Club, Institute Technical Project, IIT Bombay [Nov’19-Jan’20]
In this project I analysed HR Diagrams and their uses in Astronomy as part of a group of 4 members  
I learnt about main sequence stellar evolution, plotted HR Diagrams on python and estimate factors like age, distance (using isochrone fitting) etc. of globular clusters whose data was obtained from the Hubble UV Globular-Cluster Survey - HUGS Catalogue
