# Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams
## Nov’19-Jan’20
## Krittika Winter Projects, Krittika - The Astronomy Club, Institute Technical Project, IIT Bombay
### In this project I analysed HR Diagrams and their uses in Astronomy as part of a group of 4 members
### I built a strong base of Astronomy and main sequence stellar evolution, used isochrone fitting on Python to plot HR Diagrams and estimated factors like age, distance and others of globular clusters whose data was obtained from the Hubble UV Globular-Cluster Survey - HUGS Catalogue
