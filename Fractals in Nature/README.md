# Fractals in Nature 
### [Sept’20-Dec’20]
### Prof. Amitabha Nandi, Nonlinear Dynamics, IIT Bombay
As part of a group of four, I studied the fundamentals of fractals by calculating fractal dimension - simulating the Mandelbrot and
Julia sets. Moreover, I personally calculated the fractal dimension of real world objects like Broccoli and Romanesco by experimentally
determining cross sectional dimension and fitting it to a Pythagoras tree model
